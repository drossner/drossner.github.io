## Abstract
> We SPORE, a Spatial Recommender System. As we
enter a period of unprecedented collaboration between authors and
computers, where artificial intelligence in particular seems likely to
act increasingly in a co-authoring capacity, SPORE offers a different
approach to collaboration. More organic and exploratory than other
automated or procedural systems, SPORE aims to mimic the process
of storybreaking that already exists in the creative industries.
